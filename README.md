### Smart Contracts


- To Compile the Smart Contracts Run in the root dierectory the following command:

- For some reason, the most recent ethers does not work well with react-routers, for this I have to change from `ethers@6.0.2` to `ethers@5.7.2` when I need to run the React Application.
    
    ``` npx hardhat compile ```

- To Deploy the Smart Contract on Sepolia Testnet: 
    - Visit www.Alchemy.com
    - Login
    - Create new Project
    -  Run the following command from the root directory
        
        ```npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia```

        Expected Output:
        
        ```PostContract deployed to: address_to_be_placed_as_the_contract_address```




### React Application

- In the Root Directory Run Command: 

``` yarn start ```
